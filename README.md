My solutions for programming practice questions on HackerRank.

This repository contains my solutions for the coding problems on HackerRank. The problems are grouped by their features, such as data strucutures, algorithms, SQL, Java, Python etc.

The algorithms problems are coded in Java as I'm more familiar with data structures in Java. I'll slowly revisit the problems trying to program in Python as well.

In each problem, I will provide the link to the problem itself on HackerRank and my script. Note that my code may be suboptimal regarding to computation and storage complexity but I will try my best to optimize them.
